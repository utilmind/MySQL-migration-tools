# MySQL / MariaDB Database Migration Tools

Windows batch (`.bat`) scripts and Linux Bash (`.sh`) utilities for creating SQL dumps of single or multiple databases — either into separate `.sql` files or one combined all-in-one dump (including users and their grants).

The goal is to create a dump that can be easily imported into **any** MySQL or MariaDB server while preserving:

- stored procedures
- functions
- triggers
- views
- DEFINER users
- privileges (grants)
- table options (charsets, collations, row formats)
- data in its *original* encoding, regardless of original server defaults

These tools let you safely move databases between MySQL/MariaDB servers of different versions, OSes, collation defaults, etc.
They also perfect for quick deployments of an empty database structure with all initial triggers and their definers (users).

## ✨ Key Features
✔  Transfers all users and their grants/privileges (excluding system users like *root*, *mariadb.sys*, etc).<br />
✔  Ignores system databases (*mysql*, *sys*, *information_schema*, *performance_schema*).<br />
✔  Dumps either separate databases into individual files, or all databases into a single dump (`--one` option in Windows).<br />
✔  Can remove legacy MySQL compatibility comments that interfere with developer comments inside triggers.<br />
✔  Enhances the dump with `CREATE TABLE` statements containing **full original table definitions**, including character sets, collations, and row formats — ensuring data imports correctly even on servers with different defaults. This avoids issues such as “duplicate entry” errors caused by differing collations.

### 🪟 Windows Installation

1. Download the repository or copy the `*.bat` files.
2. Edit `db-dump.bat` and set:
   - PATH to MySQL,
   - HOST, PORT,
   - user/password for dumping. (If password not specified in .bat file, you will be prompted for password.)
3. Run from CMD or PowerShell.

### 🐧 Linux Installation

1. Copy the directory `_db-utils/` with all scripts:

   ```bash
   cp -R MySQL-migration-tools/_db-utils /home/youruser/
   ```

2. Create `credentials`:

   ```bash
   cd /home/youruser/_db-utils
   cp .sample.credentials.sh .credentials.sh
   nano .credentials.sh
   ```

   Fill in:

   ```bash
   dbHost="your-host"
   dbPort="3306"
   dbUser="dumpuser"
   dbPass="yourpassword"
   ```

3. Make scripts executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```

# ⚙️ Usage

## 🪟 Windows

### Database Dumps with Users

Open `db-dump.bat` in a text editor and review the CONFIG block.

Usage:

```
db-dump.bat                      → dumps all DBs separately
db-dump.bat --ONE                → all DBs into a single file
db-dump.bat db1 db2 db3          → dump only selected DBs
db-dump.bat --ONE db1 db2 db3    → one combined SQL for selected DBs
```

#### 💡 Notes
* You can also dump remote hosts (not only database server on local PC), specifying
the hostname/IP and in the `%HOST%`/`%PORT%` variables.
* Users and grants are dumped automatically and usually prepended to the overall dump (if not skipped).
But you can also run stand-alone [`dump-users-and-grants.bat`](dump-users-and-grants.bat) separately to get the list of all non-system users and
their privileges/grants into SQL file, ready for import into another MySQL/MariaDB database.

## 🐧 Linux

### Database Dumps

**Single file (recommended).**<br />
Configuration taken from default [`.credentials.sh`](bash/.sample.credentials.sh):

```bash
./db-dump.sh /backups/all-dbs.sql
```

**Using configuration profile.**<br />
This one takes credentials from [`.production.credentials.sh`](bash/.sample.credentials.sh):

```bash
./db-dump.sh /backups/all-dbs.sql production
```

**Date-stamped filename.**<br />
Dumps all into a single SQL file. Current date in **YYYYMMDD** format substituted instead of **@** character in the file name.

```bash
./db-dump.sh "/backups/db-@.sql" production
```

💡 Use [Garbage Collector](https://github.com/utilmind/garbage-collector) tool to regularly remove outdated dumps (created by schedule/crontab) after a certain number of days.

View help and the list of available options:

```bash
./db-dump.sh --help
```

⚠️ Always make sure that device has enough space for dumps.<br />
ℹ️ MySQL (not MariaDB) can display a warning like `mysqldump: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.`
Yes, it's definitely is, but ignore this warning. This is simply the password entered or specified in the configuration,
which is substituted when calling mysqldump as a command-line parameter.<br />
⭐ If `--skip-optimize` option is not used [`db-dump.sh`](db-dump.sh) usually optimizing all MyISAM tables and analyzing InnoDB tables before each dump. But you can optimize/analyze your tables separately with [`optimize-tables.sh`](optimize-tables.sh) utility.

---

### Exporting Users & Grants (Linux)

The script `dump-users-and-grants.sh` exports MySQL/MariaDB users and their grants into a standalone SQL file.

It loads connection settings from:

- `.credentials.sh`
- or `.NAME.credentials.sh` when using `--config NAME`.

### Examples

#### Export all non-system users:

```bash
./dump-users-and-grants.sh ./user-grants.sql
```

#### Use a specific configuration:

```bash
./dump-users-and-grants.sh --config production ./user-grants.sql
```

Uses `.production.credentials.sh`.

#### Filter by multiple prefixes:

```bash
./dump-users-and-grants.sh ./user-grants.sql --user-prefix "mydb anotherdb"
```

or:

```bash
./dump-users-and-grants.sh ./grants.sql \
    --user-prefix mydb \
    --user-prefix anotherdb
```

#### Include system users:

```bash
./dump-users-and-grants.sh ./grants.sql --include-system-users
```

---

## 🧹 Stand-alone Table Optimization (`optimize-tables.sh`)

The script [`optimize-tables.sh`](bash/optimize-tables.sh) can be used **independently**, without running a full dump.

It safely performs:

- `OPTIMIZE TABLE` on **MyISAM** tables  
- `ANALYZE TABLE` on **InnoDB** tables  
- Automatically skips unsupported engines  
- Never modifies table data or structure  
- Excludes backup tables matching `*_backup_*`.<br />
(Because developers often duplicate existing production table to the `tablename_backup_YYYY-MM-DD` when doing important structural
changes or data fixes, to quickly roll back everything if something goes wrong, but `*_backup_*` are really not needed in the dump.)

This tool is ideal for scheduled maintenance (cron) or manual performance checks.

---

### ✔ How it selects tables

The script supports **three independent modes**:

#### 1) Explicit list of tables (manual mode)

If the **2nd parameter** contains a quoted list of tables:

```bash
./optimize-tables.sh production "table1 table2 log_2025 user_session"
```

Then:

- `dbTablePrefix` is ignored  
- Only these tables are inspected  
- Their engines are detected via `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`

---

### 2) Prefix-based mode (automatic)

If the credentials file defines:

```bash
dbTablePrefix=('user_' 'order_' 'session_')
```

Then only tables starting with these prefixes are optimized/analyzed.

Backup tables are ALWAYS excluded:

```
*_backup_*
```

---

#### 3) Full-database mode (default)

If **`dbTablePrefix` is not defined**,  
or **defined but empty**,  
and **no explicit table list is provided**,  

then **all** tables from the database are processed (except backup tables):

```bash
./optimize-tables.sh production
```

---

### ✔ How to run it

#### Using default credentials:

```bash
./optimize-tables.sh
```

(using `.credentials.sh`)

#### Using a configuration profile:

```bash
./optimize-tables.sh production
```

(using `.production.credentials.sh`)

#### With explicit table list:

```bash
./optimize-tables.sh production "silk_session silk_order silk_log"
```

---

### ✔ Cron usage example (Linux)

```bash
0 5 * * * /home/user/_db-utils/optimize-tables.sh production >/dev/null 2>&1
```

Runs daily at 05:00 and keeps the database healthy.

## 💬 About MySQL Compatibility Comments

MySQL and MariaDB dumps often include “versioned” compatibility comments such as:

```sql
/*!50003 CREATE*/ /*!50017 DEFINER=`user`@`host`*/ /*!50003 TRIGGER ... END */;
```

These `/*!xxxxx ... */` blocks are executed only on servers with a version number
equal or higher than the encoded one (e.g., `50003` → MySQL 5.0.3). On older versions,
they’re treated as normal comments and ignored.

This mechanism was meant for backward compatibility between MySQL versions, but on
modern MySQL/MariaDB setups, it’s usually unnecessary — and can even cause syntax errors.
For example, if a trigger body contains a developer comment `/* ... */` inside
a versioned block, it may conflict with the outer wrapper and break the SQL import.

The [`strip-mysql-compatibility-comments.py`](bash/strip-mysql-compatibility-comments.py)
**removes these compatibility wrappers** while preserving the real developers comments
in the function/trigger bodies.

Additionally, if a table metadata provided in TSV format, it will also
normalize `CREATE TABLE` statements to include ENGINE, ROW_FORMAT,
DEFAULT CHARSET and COLLATE according to the original server
metadata extracted from information_schema.TABLES.

---

## 🧩 Compatibility Notes

* Some commands in the dump may be incompatible with very old MySQL versions.
  For example, `CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS` appeared only in MySQL 5.7+.
  If migrating to older versions, replace it with `CREATE USER` and remove the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause.
* If you encounter more incompatibilities, please open a discussion in the [Issues](../../issues) section or submit a pull request — feel free to update this `README` too.

## 🧠 Important Things to Remember When Migrating MySQL Databases

1. **Never modify system tables or users**
   (`information_schema`, `performance_schema`, `mysql`, `sys`, and users like `root`, `mariadb.sys`, etc.).
   If system data gets corrupted, reinstall the database server instead of trying to fix it manually.

2. **Do not copy databases as binary files.**
   It might work for MyISAM tables but will fail for InnoDB and others.

3. **Be aware of charset and collation differences between servers.**
   Default character sets often differ between MySQL/MariaDB versions or server configurations.
   The standard `mysqldump` skips charset/collation options if they match the server defaults — which can lead to corrupted data or collation mismatches after import.

   Example:<br />
   A field defined as `UNIQUE index` may reject an insert if the new server’s collation treats certain characters as equivalent.
   For instance, in `utf8mb4_general_ci`, Ukrainian letters **г** and **ґ** are distinct, but in `utf8mb4_uca1400_ai_ci` they are treated as equal.
   So inserting differnt words like Ukrainian “ґрати” (“gate”) after “грати” (“to play”) would trigger a duplicate-key error.
   This script prevents such issues by ensuring each `CREATE TABLE` statement fully specifies its original charset, collation, and options.

4. *(Just a tip)* — Errors during import may flash by unnoticed in the terminal.
   Always redirect them to a log file, e.g.:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p < _db-dump.sql > errors.log
   ```

## 🧰 To-Do

- Selective user/grant extraction. (When dumping selected databases, include to dump only the relevant users/grants.)
- SQL dialect converter (MySQL → PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.) Yes, this is can be complicated for automatic conversions in stored procedures and tiggers, but still possible. Maybe using AI.
