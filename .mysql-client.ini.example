; MySQL / MariaDB client option file
;
; This file is intentionally kept OUT of version control (see .gitignore).
; It stores sensitive connection settings (user, password, SSL options)
; that must not be hardcoded in shared *.bat scripts.
;
; When present, this file is automatically loaded by `db-dump.bat`,
; `db-import.bat` and `dump-users-and-grants.bat` via:
;
;   --defaults-extra-file=.mysql-client.ini
;
; Notes:
; - This file is OPTIONAL. If it does not exist, the scripts fall back to
;   the default / hardcoded settings and interactive password prompt.
; - Settings defined here have HIGHER priority than values hardcoded
;   in the batch scripts.
; - Command-line options still have the highest priority and therefore
;   are intentionally minimized when this file is used.
;
; Security:
; - Restrict file permissions so only your OS user can read this file.
; - NEVER COMMIT this file to a public repository.
;   And actually even if you commit it to private repo, it should not
;   expose the real password.
;
; Structure:
; - [client]     - common connection settings (host, user, password, SSL)
; - [mysqldump]  - dump-specific options (optional)
; - [mysql]      - import-specific options (optional)
;
; You do NOT need to duplicate credentials between sections.
; MySQL clients automatically inherit shared options from [client].
